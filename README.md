# Keyboard-Controlled Robot Simulation using Webots and Python

In this project, I am learning how to control a robot using the keyboard in Webots with Python. This helps me understand the basic concepts of motor control and how to send commands to a robot in real time. By pressing different keys, I can move the robot forward, backward, left, or right — just like controlling a real robot using a remote. This is my first step in learning how to give movement instructions to a robot through programming.

This learning is very important because it builds the foundation for advanced robotics and automation. Many robots used in industries, such as robotic arms or delivery robots, are programmed using similar logic. By understanding how to control motors and respond to user input, I’m preparing to work with real robots that can use sensors and artificial intelligence to make decisions automatically.

This project is a small but meaningful part of my robotics journey. It helps me develop the skills needed to create intelligent and interactive machines. In the future, I can use this knowledge to design robots that follow lines, avoid obstacles, or even work in factories to make human tasks easier and safer.
